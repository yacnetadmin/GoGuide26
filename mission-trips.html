            <h2 class="section-title">KNOW BEFORE YOU GO</h2>
            
            <div class="intro-content">
                <p>This resource is designed to guide you in making a decision about serving on a local or overseas short-term mission team. It will act as the starting point in opening your heart to the needs that are prevalent both locally and globally.</p>

                <div class="intro-reasons">
                    <div class="reason">
                        <h3>Why do we go?</h3>
                        <p>By going, we are taking intentional steps into the Great Commission of Jesus to <em>go and make disciples of all nations.</em> The good news of the gospel needs to be heard and experienced throughout the world and, as believers in Christ, we play a role in sharing this good news. When we go, we serve as Christ's ambassadors as if He was making His appeal through us.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="reason">
                        <h3>Support those who have served before you.</h3>
                        <p>Philippians 4:10 says, <em>I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it.</em> By joining those who have served on previous teams, we are not only thanking them for their work but we are strengthening the relationship through the bonds of servanthood.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="reason">
                        <h3>Be a part of the work.</h3>
                        <p>Matthew 9:37-38 states, <em>The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.</em> Serving as a worker on a short-term trip can look different depending upon the trip. With this guide, our goal is to provide an effective resource that helps those serving further their work for the Kingdom of God.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="reason">
                        <h3>Grow as disciples.</h3>
                        <p>2 Corinthians 5:17-18 says, <em>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here! All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation.</em> This process of sanctification is a continual transformation of our hearts. When we experience the deep need and brokenness of other cultures, God does something in us. Serving on a short-term trip is a powerful way to discover and experience the great need of the world and to nurture a desire for sharing His love with others.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="reason">
                        <h3>Trust God</h3>
                        <p><em>Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust - Psalm 40:4</em> Praying before choosing to go on a trip is vital in making your decision. It should be made out of a sincere dialogue and desire to serve our Lord and Savior first. If you sense the Spirit leading you to take this step of faith, please know that God will provide the way for you to go. Money should not be an obstacle for anyone who desires to go on a trip. York Alliance Family of Churches does provide some funding for all who participate on a trip through a church-wide love offering. Additional request for funds will be considered on a case by case basis.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide assistance in home maintenance and small interior and exterior projects</li>
                            <li>Perform minor plumbing and electrical work (some skill level required)</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>York Alliance has been partnering with the Straws since they went overseas in 2007 when they started an aviation ministry in central Africa. Prior to that they served in local church ministry in the US for almost 15 years. This new ministry will allow both of them to use their experience and skills from the field to care well for others who need a time of refreshment and renewal. This much needed work will be available to a variety of organizations and denominations who send workers overseas for extended periods of time.</p>

                        <p>The focus of this trip is to prepare and lead a retreat for Roma Christian church leaders and missionaries working with Roma in the cities of Bitola and Prilep. The retreat will take place at a hotel/conference center along Lake Ohrid. We are looking for team members who can be involved in the retreat in one of the following ways:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Leading or playing music for worship sessions</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>The goals of the retreat are to provide a space for Roma leaders to be encouraged through God's Word and by each other, and to rest from their regular work. The team will build relationships with the Roma, encourage local believers, and support local churches as necessary. Other activities will be determined based on the size and make-up of the mission team.</p>

                        <p>The Roma are a marginalized, unreached people group that is primarily of Muslim background.</p>

                        <p>Serve alongside our International Workers to establish a co-working space ministry for college students in the local community. The space will aim to create a relaxing & inviting atmosphere for freelancers, university students, entrepreneurs, and for those working abroad that are in town for an extended stay. Engage in the following activities.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide events or workshops on topics of interest</li>

                        <p>Those interested in going should have some ideas on what topic they would like to engage/teach/lead in. Examples of topics include, teaching first aid, leading a workshop on creating a website or some other technical area of expertise, providing basic music lessons, financial planning, art seminar, photography, and creating resumes.</p>

                        <p>York Alliance began partnering with a family who moved to this region of the world three years ago. Their desire is to establish a co-working space in the local community that nearby college students can come to study, learn about different topics, and hang out. The space will also serve as a café and bakery employs women who have been rescued from trafficking. Our partnership includes support through the Great Commission Fund and through intentional prayer. God is doing great things in this part of the world and it's great to be able to assist them in His work.</p>
